“Verdant Eye Where Technology Nurtures Nature”

Verdant Eye is our project, built around the idea of using autonomous robots to move through terrain and monitor the health of plants. By combining mobility with intelligent sensing, these robots can give real-time insights into how vegetation is coping with its environment. Our aim is to make plant health assessment more efficient, accurate, and accessible.
